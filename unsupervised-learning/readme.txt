unsupervised learning (data + code)

0409update:
    improve:
            1.use stop words;  2.remove 'Division_y'
    add:
            part6-business conclusion  and  
            part7-Bivariate Analysis
            
0412update:
    1.merge part5 and part6 together, drop useless detail
    2.re-define 'Met_SLA', did not influence other part but Bivariate Analysis
    3.add visulization for categorical variables in business conclusion
    4.fix some typo error
    
0430update:
    1.fix PCA function, use Zscore to scale value before PCA
      BTW, key conclusion not changed after fix, but some detail changed.
    2.fullfill bivariate analysis, fix the gap between unsupervied-learning and supervised-learning
      use chi2 test to shows that features created by unsupervised-learning has higher correlation with 'Met_SLA' than raw features.
